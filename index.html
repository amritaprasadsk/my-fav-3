    <h1> Roblox <br> <h2> is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation. It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Roblox is free-to-play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called "Robux". As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States.</h2></h1>

    <img class="image" src="220px-Pewdiepie_head_shot.jpeg"> <h1> Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg <br> <h2> born 24 October 1989), known online as PewDiePie is a Swedish YouTuber and comedian, known primarily for his Let's Play videos and comedic formatted shows.

Born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel "PewDiePie" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.

Kjellberg's channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013, but after he publicly vied for the title with T-Series in 2019, it currently holds the title of the third-most subscribed, albeit remaining the most-subscribed operated by an individual. Kjellberg had the most-viewed channel on YouTube from 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, and the channel currently ranks as the 23rd-most-viewed, and the sixth among those operated by an individual. As of April 2021, his channel has over 110 million subscribers and has received over 27 billion views.

        Kjellberg's popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and content creators. Due to this audience and media attention, his coverage of indie games has created an Oprah effect, boosting sales for titles he plays. In 2016, Time magazine named him one of the world's 100 most influential people.</h2></h1>
